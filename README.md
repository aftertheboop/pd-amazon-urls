Woocommerce plugin to create short URLs for Woocommerce products with a valid ASIN.

## Description

This plugin can be used to generate short URLs on your Woocommerce enabled website's domain to direct users to the Amazon product page or review page when clicked.

The plugin also generates a QR code to the short URL with Google's chart API.

You can use these short URLs or QR codes as "legitimate" links to your products on Amazon rather than long URLs or shortened, "suspicious" looking URLs like bit.ly. Perfect for posting on social media or including in packaging to nicely ask for a review.

## Installation

Copy the contents of the zip file to your /wp-content/plugins folder and activate it from the Wordpress Plugins menu.

Make sure to set a URL prefix in the plugin's settings.

Enter a valid ASIN on the Woocommerce product page and save your product. The short URL and QR code will be available when the page reloads.

## Requirements 

This plugin requires Woocommerce to run.
